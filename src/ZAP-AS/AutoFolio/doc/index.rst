AutoFolio documentation!
=================================
AutoFolio is an algorithm selection tool,
i.e., selecting a well-performing algorithm for a given instance [Rice 1976].
In contrast to other algorithm selection tools,
users of AutoFolio are bothered with the decision which algorithm selection approach to use
and how to set its hyper-parameters.
AutoFolio uses one of the state-of-the-art algorithm configuration tools, namely SMAC [Hutter et al LION'16]
to automatically determine a well-performing algorithm selection approach
and its hyper-parameters for a given algorithm selection data.
Therefore, AutoFolio has a robust performance across different algorithm selection tasks.

   For a detailed description of its main idea,

AutoFolio is mainly written in Python 3.5.

.. note::

    This version is a re-implementation of the original AutoFolio implementation
    and has not the same configuration space of the original implementation --
    e.g., the clustering approach was not re-implementation because the performance had not met our expectations;
    e.g., as a new approach we implemented pair-wise performance difference prediction approach.
