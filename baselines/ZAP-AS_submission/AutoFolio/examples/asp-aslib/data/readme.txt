These data set was generated for a publication about claspfolio 2.0,
i.e., an algorithm selector for ASP.
The algorithm portfolio of clasp (2.1.4) configuration is generated by the hydra method (see http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/Hydra/)
in combination with SMAC.
To generate the features, I used claspre, a light-weight version of the ASP solver clasp,
with static and dynamic features (4 restarts each after 32 conflicts).
